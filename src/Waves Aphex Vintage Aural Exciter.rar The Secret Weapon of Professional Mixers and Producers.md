The Aphex Aural Exciter is not a typical EQ or compressor. It works by generating harmonics that are related to the original signal, but not present in it. These harmonics can make your tracks sound more alive, clear and spacious, without adding any unwanted distortion or noise. The plugin also features a tube emulation that adds some analog warmth and saturation to your sound.
  
The plugin has three main controls: AX Mode, Mix and Input. The AX Mode lets you choose between four different modes of operation: 1) Original - the classic sound of the original hardware unit; 2) Modern - a more transparent and refined sound; 3) Mix - a special mode designed for mastering and bus processing; and 4) Live - a mode optimized for live sound applications. The Mix control lets you adjust the balance between the dry and wet signals, while the Input control lets you set the input level for optimal performance.
  
The plugin also has a meter section that shows you the input level, output level and gain reduction. You can also switch between stereo and mono modes, as well as bypass the plugin altogether.
  
The Waves Aphex Vintage Aural Exciter plugin comes with over 60 presets, including custom ones from Val Garay himself, that showcase the versatility of the plugin for different types of instruments, vocals, mixes and even PA systems. You can also tweak the presets or create your own to suit your needs.

Now that you have learned how to use the Waves Aphex Vintage Aural Exciter plugin, you might be wondering how to apply it to your own mixes. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you get the most out of this plugin:
  
- Use the plugin sparingly and subtly. A little goes a long way with this plugin. You don't want to overdo it and make your tracks sound harsh or unnatural. Start with a low mix level and adjust it until you hear a slight improvement in your sound.
- Experiment with different AX modes. Each mode has its own character and flavor, and can work better for different types of sounds. For example, you might prefer the Original mode for vocals, the Modern mode for guitars, the Mix mode for drums and the Live mode for keyboards.
- Use the plugin on individual tracks or buses. You can use the plugin on single tracks to enhance specific elements of your mix, or on buses to glue together groups of tracks. For example, you can use the plugin on a vocal bus to add some presence and clarity to your vocals, or on a drum bus to add some punch and depth to your drums.
- Use the plugin in parallel. You can also use the plugin in parallel with your dry signal, by using a send/return configuration or a parallel compressor. This way, you can blend in the amount of wet signal that you want, without affecting the original signal. This can give you more control and flexibility over your sound.
- Compare before and after. Always compare your sound with and without the plugin, by using the bypass switch or toggling between presets. This will help you hear the difference that the plugin makes, and decide if it's improving your sound or not.

The Waves Aphex Vintage Aural Exciter plugin is a powerful and versatile plugin that can add some sparkle and shine to your mixes. By following these tips and tricks, you can use it effectively and creatively to enhance your sound. Happy mixing!
