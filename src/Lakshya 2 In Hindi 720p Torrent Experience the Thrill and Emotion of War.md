Lakshya 2 is a term that can refer to two different things: a movie and a missile. The movie is a sequel to Lakshya, a 2021 Telugu-language sports drama film directed by Santhossh Jagarlapudi and starring Naga Shaurya, Ketika Sharma, Jagapathi Babu and Sachin Khedekar[^1^]. The film follows the story of Pardhu, an archer who wants to represent India at the World Championships. The missile is an advanced version of Lakshya-1, a pilotless target aircraft developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) of India[^2^]. It is a target for weapon systems like radar-guided and heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles and air-to-air missiles. It has a scoring system capable of calculating the miss distance of the weapon accurately.
 
Both the movie and the missile are related to the concept of lakshya, which means "goal" or "aim" in Hindi. The movie shows how Pardhu overcomes his challenges and achieves his lakshya of becoming a champion archer. The missile helps the Indian armed forces to test their weapons and improve their lakshya of hitting the enemy targets.
