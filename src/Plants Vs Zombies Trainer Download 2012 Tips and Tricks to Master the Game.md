# How to Download and Use Plants Vs Zombies Trainer in 2012
 
Plants Vs Zombies is a popular tower defense game that was released in 2009 by PopCap Games. The game involves planting various types of plants to fend off waves of zombies that try to eat your brains. The game has multiple modes, levels, and mini-games that offer hours of fun and challenge.
 
However, if you want to make the game easier or more interesting, you might want to use a trainer. A trainer is a program that modifies the game's memory and allows you to activate cheats such as unlimited sun, money, fertilizer, bug spray, instant recharge, one-hit kill, and more. A trainer can also unlock new items and modes that are normally unavailable in the game.
