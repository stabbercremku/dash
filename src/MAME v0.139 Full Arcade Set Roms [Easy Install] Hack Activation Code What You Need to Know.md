- A computer with Windows, Linux or Mac OS X.
- A copy of MAME 0.139, which you can download from [the official website](https://www.mamedev.org/release.html).
- A torrent client, such as [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), to download the roms.
- A lot of disk space, as the roms collection is about 50 GB in size.

## Step 1: Download the Roms
  
The first step is to download the MAME v0.139 Full Arcade Set Roms from [this link](https://archive.org/details/MAME0.139RomCollectionByGhostware). This is a torrent file, so you will need a torrent client to download it. We recommend using qBittorrent, as it is free and easy to use.
  
Once you have qBittorrent installed, open the torrent file and choose a location to save the roms. The download may take some time, depending on your internet speed and the number of seeders available.
  
## Step 2: Extract the Roms
  
After the download is complete, you will have a folder with thousands of zip files. Each zip file contains one or more roms for a specific game. You will need to extract these files to a folder where MAME can find them.
  
You can use any software that can handle zip files, such as [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). We recommend creating a new folder called "roms" inside the folder where you installed MAME. Then, select all the zip files and extract them to the "roms" folder.
  
## Step 3: Activate the Hack
  
Some of the roms in this collection may not work properly with MAME 0.139, as they may require newer versions of MAME or additional files that are not included. To fix this issue, you will need to activate a hack that modifies some of the roms and makes them compatible with MAME 0.139.
  
To activate the hack, you will need to download a file called "MAME v0.139 Full Arcade Set Roms [Easy Install] hack activation code.zip" from [this link](https://archive.org/details/MAME0.139_MAME2010_Reference_Set_ROMs_CHDs_Samples). This file contains a code that will automatically apply the hack to your roms when you run MAME.
  
Once you have downloaded the file, extract it to the same folder where you installed MAME. You should see a file called "mame.ini" inside the folder. This is a configuration file that tells MAME how to run.
  
Open "mame.ini" with a text editor, such as Notepad or WordPad. Scroll down until you find a line that says "# CORE SEARCH PATH OPTIONS". Under this line, you should see another line that says "rompath roms". This tells
