# How to Reset the Toner of Samsung ML 1640 Printer with Firmware V1.01.00.78
 
If you have a Samsung ML 1640 printer with firmware V1.01.00.78, you may encounter a problem when the toner runs out and the printer stops printing. This is because the printer has a microchip that counts the number of pages printed and prevents further printing when the toner reaches a certain limit. To overcome this issue, you need to reset the microchip and reinstall the toner cartridge. Here are the steps to do so:
 
1. Refill the original toner cartridge that came with the printer or buy a compatible one. If you have another cartridge, remove the chip and the fuse from it.
2. Open up the printer's back cover and locate the smaller board that has a 93c66 chip on it. The chip is a tiny one with eight pins, as shown in this picture: [http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/7835/reset.jpg](http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/7835/reset.jpg). The chip you are looking for is the one that has a green wire on it in the picture, but yours won't have the wire.
3. Connect pins 1 and 4 of the chip with a paper clip or a wire. Pins 1 and 4 are the ones that are connected with the green wire in the picture. Do not touch the paper clip or wire with your fingers, use some pliers or tweezers.
4. With the paper clip or wire connected, turn on the printer and wait for 15 seconds. You will notice that the control light on the front of the printer will change from red to green and back.
5. Turn off the printer and disconnect the paper clip or wire.
6. Put the cover back and insert the refilled toner cartridge into the printer.
7. Uninstall and reinstall the printer driver on your computer.
8. Turn on the printer and print a test page. If the print quality is good, you have successfully reset the toner. If not, you may need to change the toner cartridge.

Note: This method will not work if you have a newer version of firmware on your printer, such as V1.01.00.83 or higher. In that case, you may need to flash your printer with an older version of firmware, such as V1.01.00.60, using a software tool.

Resetting the toner or cartridge or changing the cartridge is not the same as resetting the printer's microchip. If you have had a problem with the toner or cartridge, please contact your dealer for a replacement.
